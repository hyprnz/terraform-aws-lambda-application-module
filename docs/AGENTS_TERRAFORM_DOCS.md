# Generating Terraform Docs README

Use EN-NZ or EN-AU spelling for all text in READMEs and documentation.

Our Terraform Docs-style READMEs are intended for individual contributors who need context on the Terraform module parameters. They should expose all variables

If asked to generate a Terraform Docs README file for the module the guidelines must be followed:
* if a README exists, place the terraform docs content between the README and Licensing content
* Structure the README with sections in this order: Description, Usage, Requirements, Providers, Modules, Resources, Inputs, Outputs.
* Add a Description section summarizing the module's purpose and key features.
* Include a Usage section with a Terraform example showing how to call the module using Git source and version tags, with placeholders like `<some-tag>` for version tags and custom tag values.
* Ensure the Inputs table only lists the allowed variables, generated by terraform-docs but manually filtered if needed.
